Here I'll put ideas I don't want to forget about the content of our webpage

1.) A brief introduction to ux/ui and its purpose. 

2.) The webpage will be split into two sections. The first category will be written about the all 
different disabilities assigned. 


3.) The second section will be about how each disability affects someone 
and what we can do to help them.

4.) A conclusion about why it's important for ux/ui to support people with disabilities. 
How we can help people this way. What we can do to spread awareness.
