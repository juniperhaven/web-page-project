Here I'll put ideas I don't want to forget about the content of our webpage

1.) A brief introduction to ux/ui and its purpose. 

2.) The webpage will be split into two sections. The first category will be written about the all 
different disabilities assigned. 

3.) The second section will be about how each disability affects someone 
and what we can do to help them.

4.) A conclusion about why it's important for ux/ui to support people with disabilities. 
How we can help people this way. What we can do to spread awareness.



note from Cedar:
I think we should divide each section into subsections--so like, in the first category, the overarching section could be 'an overview of
types of disabilities that require accommodations in UX/UI' and then within that there'd be a section for each category of disability,
since there's four categories overall
and then that trend continues, with 'how these disabilities affect people' also being split into four subsections for each category of
disability, and then accommodations that help websites be more accessible for each category of disability
