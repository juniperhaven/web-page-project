   <h1>Understanding accessibility</h1>
   <p>Accessibility allows the users of all abilities to underdstand how to use and enjoy the web. 
    as a web designer or developer it our job to make sure that every bit of our webpage is accessable to everyone.
    Accessibility is not confined to a group of users with some different abilities, for example, visual, motor, auditory, speech, or cognitive disabilities, rather it extends to anyone who is experiencing any permanent, temporary or situational disability. 
    havingf only one hand its a permanet disability where having a braken hand is a short terms short term disability,so understand all those different parts and creating something can be more flexable is crucial to web design.</p>
