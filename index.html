            <h1>What is UX and UI Accessibility?</h1>
            <p>Let's start with UI. UI, or 'user interface', is a digital medium that users interect with. UX, meanwhile, focuses on a user's experience while interacting with a product.<br>Simply put, UX principles are the core point of advice and guidance for one to create useful, easy-to-use designs, by carefully creating, selecting and organizing features and elements into our designs or products.<br>Every element or feature must have a purpose and placement which is familiar and intuitive to the user, as not to distract or confuse them on their journey. For UI, these are the fundamentals you need to understand:</p>  
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>color and contrast</li>
                    <li>white space</li>
                    <li>visual hierarchy </li>
                    <li>consistencey</li>
                    <li>scale</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>For UX, these are the fundamnetals you need to understand:</p>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>usability comes first</li>   
                    <li>the user's needs</li>
                    <li>acessibility</li>
                    <li>simple language</li>
                    <li>consistency</li>
                    <li>the user should be in control</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
                
            <h1>Understanding Accessibility</h1>
            <p>Accessibility allows users of all abilities to use and enjoy the web. As web designers or developers, particularly those who are UX or UI designers or developers, it is our job to make sure that every bit of our webpage is accessible to everyone.<br>Accessibility is not confined to a group of users with a specific disability. There are many different kinds of disabilities that might affect a user's experience on the internet or change the things they need to successfully use a user interface. There are visual, auditory, speech, cognitive, and motor skill disabilities. The label 'disabled' extends to anyone who is experiencing any permanent, temporary, or situational disability. The ones that are likely to affect a user's experience on the web are disabilities that cause visual impairments, hearing impairments, cognitive impairments, or motor skill impairments.</p>

            <h1>Different Kinds of Accommodations Needed</h1>

            <h2>Accommodations for Users With Visual Impairments</h2>
            <p>Users who have impaired vision would be those who are blind, color blind, have a condition that causes contrast loss, such as glaucoma, cataracts, or retinopathy, which is damage to the retinas, or have otherwise poor vision. These users may require different accommodations depending on which category they fall into, but as they are all visual impairments, these accommodations may sometimes overlap.</p>
            <p>Let's start with the accommodations needed for users who are blind.<br>Users who are blind are more likely to use screen readers than your average user, so for them, what really matters is that elements be clearly and accurately labeled in your HTML so their screen reader can accurately convey the information to their user.</p>
            <p>Here is what the color wheel looks like to different color blind users. From left to right, you see the color wheel for someone with deuteranopia (can't see green), protanopia (can't see red), and tritanopia (can't see blue). For comparison, what the color wheel looks like for people with normal color vision has been placed on the end:</p>
            <img class="color-wheel" src="assets/images/colorblindness - deuteranopia (no green).png" alt="The color wheel that a person with green color blindness would see.">
            <img class="color-wheel" src="assets/images/colorblindness - protanopia (no red).png" alt="The color wheel that a person with red color blindness would see.">
            <img class="color-wheel" src="assets/images/colorblindness - tritanopia (no blue).png" alt="The color wheel that a person with blue color blindness would see.">
            <img class="color-wheel" src="assets/images/normal color wheel.png" alt="The color wheel that people with regular color vision see.">
            <p>As a note, 'red-green color blindness' is a catch-all term for users with either protanopia or deuteranopia. Those are the two most common kinds of color blindness, but you should always make sure your website looks good and is usable for users with tritanopia as well.</p>
