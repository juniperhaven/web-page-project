            <h1>What is UX and UI Accessibility?</h1>
            <p>Let's start with UI. UI, or 'user interface', is a digital medium that users interect with. UX, meanwhile, focuses on a user's experience while interacting with a product.<br>Simply put, UX principles are the core point of advice and guidance for one to create useful, easy-to-use designs, by carefully creating, selecting and organizing features and elements into our designs or products.<br>Every element or feature must have a purpose and placement which is familiar and intuitive to the user, as not to distract or confuse them on their journey. For UI, these are the fundamentals you need to understand:</p>  
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>color and contrast</li>
                    <li>white space</li>
                    <li>visual hierarchy </li>
                    <li>consistencey</li>
                    <li>scale</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>For UX, these are the fundamnetals you need to understand:</p>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>usability comes first</li>   
                    <li>the user's needs</li>
                    <li>acessibility</li>
                    <li>simple language</li>
                    <li>consistency</li>
                    <li>the user should be in control</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
                
            <h1>Understanding Accessibility</h1>
            <p>Accessibility allows users of all abilities to use and enjoy the web. As web designers or developers, particularly those who are UX or UI designers or developers, it is our job to make sure that every bit of our webpage is accessible to everyone.<br>Accessibility is not confined to a group of users with a specific disability. There are many different kinds of disabilities that might affect a user's experience on the internet or change the things they need to successfully use a user interface. There are visual, auditory, speech, cognitive, and motor skill disabilities. The label 'disabled' extends to anyone who is experiencing any permanent, temporary, or situational disability. The ones that are likely to affect a user's experience on the web are disabilities that cause visual impairments, hearing impairments, cognitive impairments, or motor skill impairments.</p>

            <h1>Different Kinds of Accommodations Needed</h1>

            <h2>Accommodations for Users With Visual Impairments</h2>
            <p>Users who have impaired vision would be those who are blind, color blind, have a condition that causes contrast loss, such as glaucoma, cataracts, or retinopathy, which is damage to the retinas, or have otherwise poor vision. These users may require different accommodations depending on which category they fall into, but as they are all visual impairments, these accommodations may sometimes overlap.</p>
            <p>Let's start with the accommodations needed for users who are blind.<br>Users who are blind are more likely to use screen readers than your average user, so for them, what really matters is that elements be clearly and accurately labeled in your HTML so their screen reader can accurately convey the information to their user. It's also very important to include the alt attribute on images, because otherwise screen readers won't be able to accurately describe images to their users. Additionally, body text should be at least 12px in size, though 14px-16px is preferred. This makes it easier for those who can't see well but aren't blind to read your content. Finally, keyboard shortcuts need to be available on your website, as people with impaired vision are more likely to use those to navigate websites.</p>
            <p>Next, let's talk about the accommodations necessary for people who are color blind. First and foremost, it's important that you never deliver content in a way that relies only on colors. With forms, for instance, it's common to outline fields that have been incorrectly filled in with the color red. For color blind users, this can be impossible to navigate. Images or other indicators of where the form error is should also be included. Content should be delivered in text or symbols instead of just colors. It's also important to use colors that are well-contrasted on your webpage, and also make sure those colors don't look too similar to each other. Green and yellow might look perfectly distinct to someone with normal color vision, but for those with red-green colorblindness, they're likely to look very similar, possibly even like the same color, which makes green and yellow a poor color combination.</p>
            <p>Here is what the color wheel looks like to different color blind users. From left to right, you see the color wheel for someone with deuteranopia (can't see green), protanopia (can't see red), and tritanopia (can't see blue). For comparison, what the color wheel looks like for people with normal color vision has been placed on the end:</p>
            <img class="color-wheel" src="assets/images/colorblindness - deuteranopia (no green).png" alt="The color wheel that a person with green color blindness would see.">
            <img class="color-wheel" src="assets/images/colorblindness - protanopia (no red).png" alt="The color wheel that a person with red color blindness would see.">
            <img class="color-wheel" src="assets/images/colorblindness - tritanopia (no blue).png" alt="The color wheel that a person with blue color blindness would see.">
            <img class="color-wheel" src="assets/images/normal color wheel.png" alt="The color wheel that people with regular color vision see.">
            <p>As a note, 'red-green color blindness' is a catch-all term for users with either protanopia or deuteranopia. Those are the two most common kinds of color blindness, but you should always make sure your website looks good and is usable for users with tritanopia as well.</p>
            <p>Finally, for those with contrast loss, it's very important oto make sure your colors are well-contrasted and not similar in luminosity. Colors that are too close together in brightness (luminosity levels) are likely to be hard for those with contrast loss to distinguish between, even if those colors are on opposite sides of the color wheel.</p>

            <h2>Accommodations for Users With Hearing Impairments</h2>
            <p>People who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have an auditory processing disorder all have the challenge of listening to information that is provided from the internet.
                They rely on subtitles and closed captions on music and videos. There should be summaries of the videos and topics, transcripts of audio content, to not include
                auto-play on videos, and easy access to audio options. Subtitles (closed caption) should be required on videos. If it is not manually entered, it should have an option to auto-generate 
                closed captions by translating the sound into text. Videos that do not support either of these ideas should at the very least include a summary or a description of what the video is about. 
                Auto-generated close captions, subtitles, and description boxes can also be said for audio player. In headings, paragraphs, and lists it is  important to structer content as simply as possible. 
                Well structured information helps people decide whether to engage with content, and can help stem information overload.</p>

            <h2>Accommodations for Users With Cognitive Impairments</h2>
            <p>Cognitive impairments can be caused by a number of different conditions, such as learning disabilities like dyslexia, developmental disabilities like autism or ADHD, and even mental illnesses like schizophrenia. While these conditions all affect people in very different ways, there's a few rules you should follow in UX and UI design to make your website and its interface friendly to those with conditions that affect their cognitive abilities.</p>
            <p>First and foremost, it's very important to make sure your content is as clear and easy to understand as possible. It should be delivered in multiple formats whenever possible, such as with videos accompanying text, and text-to-speech should be available. Plain language standards should be followed whenever possible, which goes back to the 'simple language' fundamental of user experience design. Plain language standards say that common, everyday words should be used as much as possible, content should be delivered in short sentences and paragraphs, and acronyms should be expanded on wherever they appear. If you can't deliver your conten in short and easy to read sentences, a TL;DR should be provided at the end of the content. Unfamiliar words should be defined whenever they're first used.</p>
            <p>Instructions on your page should also be clear, and the layout should be easy to understand and follow. Things like forms should have clear instructions and progress bars the user can see, and buttons and links should be clear about what they'll do when clicked. If there's an error in a form field, there should be words explaining what the error is--don't rely only on colors or symbols. The error message should also direct the user right to the error in the form. It's also important to minimize distractions, and this falls under making your layout easy to understand and follow. You should have few or no ads, and if your page has elements that scroll, auto-update, move, or blink, you should make it so those elements can be somehow stopped or hidden or paused. The only exception to this rule is if hiding, stopping, or pausing the element would fundamentally alter the content.</p>
            <p>Finally, you should avoid time limits on things, but if you have to include a time limit, make sure to provide the user with a way to extend the time limit or turn it off. You also need to warn the user at least 20 seconds before the time limit is up, and provide the user with an easy way to increase the time limit, such as by pressing the spacebar.Minimize distractions by not including unnexcessary content. Ads can pop out and bait-to-click you when scrolling through, if possible use
                a specific area of the website to put an ad. Elements that move, blink, scroll, or auto-update should have an option to be paused, hidden, stopped, or controlled. </p>

            <h2>Accommodations for Users With Motor Skill Impairments</h2>
            <p>This impairement has a long list of disability names that include ADHD, Parkinson's Disease, Amputees, and to tremors and lack of motor control. There are multiple ways
                change a ux/ui to accomodate these disabilites. There should be a remappable option for keyboard shortcuts available. An outline feature button or 
                links should be enabled. Touch functions are very important and should have simple interface. Tooltips, drop down menus, and pop ups should be 
                dismissable without moving the mouse. Added content can display on top of other information using magnification and can be hard to dismiss without the mouse or changing focus.
                An example of this would to remap the keyboard or use the escape button. Users should have an option to turn off motion triggers. Some content is only displayed when the mouse pointer
                is hovering over to trigger an element and disappears when the mouse moves off the trigger. For people with tremors or limited movement this can be very difficult and frustrating. To fix this,
                content must stay visible at all times, even if the mouse moves onto new content, until the user dismisses it.</p>
